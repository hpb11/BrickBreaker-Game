# BrickBreaker-Game
The Brick Breaker Game is a classic arcade game built using Java Swing and Java's AWT package.
## Game Description
The Brick Breaker Game is a fun game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and tries to break all the bricks at the top by bouncing a ball off the paddle. The player needs to move the paddle horizontally to prevent the ball from falling off the screen while aiming to destroy as many bricks as possible. Each time the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears, and the player earns points. The game ends when the player either clears all the bricks or loses all their lives by letting the ball fall off the screen.
